# CodeAlpha Python Internship Projects

This repository contains my completed tasks for the Python Programming Internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech). The internship focused on core Python concepts including data structures, file handling, OOP, and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Flask. I completed three hands-on tasks:

1. Hangman Game – A console-based word guessing game using random word selection, loops, and string handling.
2. Stock Portfolio Tracker – A script to calculate total investment from user-input stock data using a hardcoded dictionary of stock prices.
3. Email Extractor – A Python automation script that reads a `.txt` file, extracts email addresses using regular expressions, and saves them to another file.

Each project is available in a separate folder with clear and commented code. This experience has strengthened my Python skills through real-world applications.
